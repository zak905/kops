# This is a convenience script for developing kOps on GCE.
# It builds the code, including nodeup, and uploads to a custom GCS bucket.
# It also sets KOPS_STATE_STORE and KOPS_BASE_URL to project-isolated values.
# To use, source the script.  For example `. hack/dev-build-gce.sh` (note the initial `.`)

# Can't use set -e in a script we want to source
#set -e

#set -x

# Dev environments typically do not need to test multiple architectures
